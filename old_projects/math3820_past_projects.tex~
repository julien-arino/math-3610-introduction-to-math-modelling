\title{Past projects in Math 3820}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is a list of some projects that were written in Math 3820 (and previous course denominations), under the supervision of Dr. T.G. Berry. This list is sorted, as much as possible, by topical area (ordered from more popular to less popular), then by author last name.Topics where only one person wrote a project are listed in the last section. Also included (last page) is the marking scheme used by Dr. Berry for evaluating the projects.
