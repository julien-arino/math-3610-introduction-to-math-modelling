\section*{Math 3820 -- Introduction to Mathematical Modelling}

\begin{description}
\item[Lectures] Tuesday and Thursday, 11:30--12:45 @ 415 MH
\item[Office hours] Tuesday and Thursday, 10:00--11:20\\
Other times by appointment only
\end{description}


\subsection*{Course objectives}
The objective of the course is to introduce mathematical modelling, that is, the
construction and analysis of mathematical models inspired by real life problems.
The course will present several modelling techniques and the means to analyze
the resulting systems.


\subsection*{Topics}
Types of models (static, discrete time, continuous time, stochastic) with case
studies chosen from population dynamics and other fields yet to be determined.


\subsection*{Evaluation}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
Assignments & 20\% \\
Midterm & 15\% \\
Modelling project & 25\% \\
Final examination & 40\%
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Midterm and Final will be open book exams, calculators are not allowed.


\subsection*{Project}
\begin{itemize}
\item project subject must be decided before the end of February.
\item if you have a topic you are already working on, you are welcome to use it
(but the report you produce must be specific to this course).
\end{itemize}
