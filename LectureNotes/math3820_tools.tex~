\section{Descartes' rule of signs}
\label{sec:descartes}
Descartes' rule of signs is a very useful way to study the existence and sign of the roots of a polynomial without having to express them explicitely.
\begin{theorem}[Descartes' rule of signs]\label{th:descartes}
Let $p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^m a_ix^i $ be a polynomial with real coefficients such that $a_m \neq 0$.
Define $v$ to be the number of {\it variations in sign} of the sequence of coefficients $a_m, \ldots, a_0$. By `variations in sign' we mean the number of values of $n$ such that the sign of $a_n$ differs from the sign of $a_{n - 1}$, as $n$ ranges from $m$ down to 1.
Then 
\begin{itemize}
\item the number of positive real roots of $p(x)$ is $v-2N$ for some integer $N$ satisfying $0 \leq N \leq \dfrac{v}{2}$,
\item the number of negative roots of $p(x)$ may be obtained by the same method by applying the rule of signs to $p(-x)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}


\begin{example}
Let $p(x) = x^3+3x^2-x-3$. The coefficients have sign $++--$, so there is one sign change.
Thus $v = 1$. Since $0 \leq N \leq 1/2$, we must have $N=0$. Thus $v-2N=1$ and there is exactly one positive real root of $p(x)$.

To find the negative roots, we examine $p(-x) = -x^3+3x^2+x-3$. The coefficients have sign $-++-$, so there are two sign changes. Thus $v=2$ and $0 \leq N \leq 2/2= 1$.
Thus, there are two possible solutions, $N=0$ and $N=1$, and two possible values of $v-2N$. Therefore, there are either two or no negative real roots.
Furthermore, note that $p(-1)=(-1)^3+3 \cdot (-1)^2-(-1)-3=0$, hence there is at least one negative root. Therefore there must be exactly two.
\end{example}

\section{Left and right eigenvectors}
Let $M$ be an $r\times r$ matrix, $u,v$ be two column vectors, $\lambda\in\IR$. Then, if  
\[
Mu=\lambda u,
\]
$u$ is the (right) eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda$, and if
\[
v^TM=\lambda v^T
\]
then $v$ is the left eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda$. Note that to a given eigenvalue there corresponds (to a multiple) one left and one right eigenvector.
