\begin{abstract}
Question 1 was very short and should have posed no major problem, except maybe the boundedness of solutions.
\end{abstract}

\thispagestyle{empty}


\noindent{\bf 1.}
The following equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Ricker}
N_{t+1}=N_t e^{r(1-N_t/K)}
\end{equation}
is called Ricker's equation and was introduced in the context of a model of fisheries. The parameter $r\geq 0$ is the intrinsic growth rate, $K>0$ is the carrying capacity. We consider equation \eqref{eq:Ricker} together with a nonnegative initial condition $N_0$.

\noindent{\bf 1.a.}
Give an interpretation of the form of the equation.

\noindent{\bf Solution.}
The term $1-N_t/K$ is positive if $N_t<K$, negative if $N_t>K$ and zero if $N_t=K$; so these situations correspond to growth, decrease and stationarity of the population, respectively. The magnitude of the change, when there is some change, is $r$.


\noindent{\bf 1.b.}
Discuss the existence of solutions to \eqref{eq:Ricker}. Do solutions always remain nonnegative? bounded?

\noindent{\bf Solution.}
Solutions exist for all initial conditions, as the function
\[
f(N)=Ne^{r(1-N/K)}
\]
is continuous from $\IR$ to $\IR$. Also, $f:\IR_+\to\IR_+$, so solutions remain nonnegative for nonnegative initial conditions. Also, we have
\[
f'(N)=e^{r(1-N/K)}-\frac{rN}{K}e^{r(1-N/K)}=\frac{K-rN}{K}e^{r(1-N/K)}.
\]
As the exponential in this expression is always positive, the sign of $f'$ depends on that of $K-rN$. We have $K-rN<0$ if $N>K/r$, so any value of $N_t$ larger than $K/r$ leads to a solution that decreases until it becomes smaller than $K/r$. Therefore, the largest possible value of $N_t$ is $N_0$ (if the initial condition is for example much larger than $K$ or $K/r$), or 
\[
N_{max}=\max_{N\in[0,K/r]}f(N),
\]
which we know to exist since $f$ continuous. Then, for all $t$, 
\[
N_t\leq\max\{N_{max},N_0\}.
\]
In other words, solutions are bounded.


\noindent{\bf 1.c.}
Study the existence of fixed points for \eqref{eq:Ricker} and its/their stability as a function of parameter values.

\noindent{\bf Solution.}
Fixed point(s) of \eqref{eq:Ricker} satisfy the fixed point equation
\[
p=pe^{r(1-p/K)}.
\]
Clearly, $p=0$ is a solution. Also, assuming $p\neq 0$, the fixed point equation is equivalent to
\[
1=e^{r(1-p/K)}.
\]
Taking the logarithm,
\[
r(1-p/K)=0,
\]
or, in other words, $p=K$. So we have two fixed points, $N=0$ and $N=K$. 

At $N=0$,
\[
f'(0)=e^r,
\]
so $N=0$ is attractive if $e^r<1$, i.e., $r<0$. Since we have assumed $r\geq 0$, this situation is impossible and $N=0$ is always repelling.

At $N=K$,
\[
f'(K)=1-r,
\]
so $N=K$ is attractive if $|1-r|<1$, i.e., $0<r<2$, and repelling otherwise.





\newpage
\noindent{\bf 2.}
We consider the following system of ordinary differential equations
\begin{subequations}\label{sys:chemostat}
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} S &= D(S^0-S)-\frac{\mu_1}{Y_1}SP \label{sys:chemostat_S} \\
\frac{d}{dt} P &= \mu_1 SP -DP-\frac{\mu_2}{Y_2}PZ \label{sys:chemostat_P} \\
\frac{d}{dt} Z &= \mu_2 PZ-DZ \label{sys:chemostat_Z} 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
together with the nonnegative initial condition $(S(0),P(0),Z(0))=(S_0,P_0,Z_0)$. With this system, we aim to describe the interactions between a substrate $S$, phytoplankton $P$ and zooplankton $Z$ in a chemostat. All parameters are assumed to be positive.

\noindent{\bf 2.a.}
Give an interpretation of the form of \eqref{sys:chemostat}. The parameters $Y_1,Y_2$ are called \emph{yield coefficients}. Can you see why? Also, beside the addition of a zooplankton equation, what is the difference with the chemostat model we studied? Discuss this difference and its implication in terms of the assumptions made on the nutrient uptake/growth mechanism.

\noindent{\bf Solution.}
This is a regular chemostat model but with an extra species tacked on top of the resident species. This new species consumes the species that consumes the substrate. $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ describe the conversion between absorption of substrate and growth and absorption of phytoplankton and growth, respectively, as ingesting 1 unit of food does not necessarily translate into growth by 1 unit.

The absorption/growth function is here of mass-action type, meaning that contrary to a Michaelis-Menten type kinetic, it does not saturate with high values of $S$.

\noindent{\bf 2.b.}
Do solutions to \eqref{sys:chemostat} exist? are they unique? do they remain nonnegative? are they bounded?

\noindent{\bf Solution.}
Clearly, the vector field is $C^1$ (it is actually $C^\infty$, as a collection of multivariate polynomials), so solutions exist and are unique. 

Nonnegativity is established as usual. Assume nonnegative initial conditions, and assume $S(t_1)=0$ for some $t_1\geq 0$ in \eqref{sys:chemostat_S}. Maybe $t_1=0$, i.e., $S_0=0$. In that case, $S'=DS^0$ and $S(t)>0$ for $t>0$. Otherwise, $t_1>0$, but this is impossible since if $S(t_1)=0$, then $S'(t_1)\leq 0$ because $S$ must be decreasing there, and yet $S'(t_1)=DS^0>0$, a contradiction. Therefore, the only possibility for $S(t)=0$ is when $S(0)=S_0=0$.

Inspecting \eqref{sys:chemostat_P}, we see that $P=0$ is positively invariant under the flow of \eqref{sys:chemostat}. Because of uniqueness of solutions, any solution that has $P=0$ therefore needs to have $P(0)=P_0=0$ and any solution that has $P_0>0$ can never have $P(t)=0$. The situation is similar for \eqref{sys:chemostat_Z} for $Z$.
Therefore, solutions remain nonnegative for nonnegative initial conditions.

To establish boundedness, consider the variable $M=S+P+Z$ representing the total biomass (organic and inorganic) in the chemostat. We have
\begin{align*}
M' &= (S+P+Z)' \\
&= DS^0-DS-DP-DZ-\frac{1-Y_1}{Y_1}\mu_1 SP-\frac{1-Y_2}{Y_2}\mu_2 PZ \\
&\leq D(S^0-M),
\end{align*}
where we have assumed that $Y_i\leq 1$. Note that this is a valid hypothesis: conversion always occurs at a loss (or at least, does not create more mass than is present), so absorption of $N$ units of nutrient always results in growth by an amount $YN$, with $Y\leq 1$.

As a consequence, $\lim_{t\to\infty}M(t)=S^0$. Since solutions are nonnegative, this implies that they are bounded.


\noindent{\bf 2.c.}
We propose to \emph{nondimensionalize} the system to transform it into a system easier to study yet possessing the same properties. For this, we introduce the following change of variables
\[
x=\frac{S}{S^0},\quad y=\frac{P}{Y_1S^0},\quad z=\frac{Z}{Y_1Y_2S^0}
\]
and of time
\[
t=DT.
\]
(Note that $d/dT=D\; d/dt$.)
Show that, using these, \eqref{sys:chemostat} can be transformed into the following system
\begin{subequations}\label{sys:chemostat_nondim}
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dT} x &= 1-x-Axy \label{sys:chemostat_nondim_x} \\
\frac{d}{dT} y &= Axy-y-Byz \label{sys:chemostat_nondim_y} \\
\frac{d}{dT} z &= Byz-z, \label{sys:chemostat_nondim_z}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where
\[
A=\frac{\mu_1S^0}{D},\quad \beta=\frac{\mu_2S^0Y_1}{D}.
\]

\noindent{\bf Solution.}


\noindent{\bf 2.d.}
Verify that the properties established in {\bf 2.b} are still true for \eqref{sys:chemostat_nondim}.

\noindent{\bf Solution.}

\noindent{\bf 2.e.}
Show that an (asymptotic) mass conservation property holds for \eqref{sys:chemostat_nondim}, so that, for all nonnegative initial conditions,
\[
\lim_{t\to\infty} x(t)+y(t)+z(t)=1.
\]

\noindent{\bf Solution.}
Let $M=x+y+z$. Then
\[
M'=1-(x+y+z)=1-M,
\]
and as previously, $\lim_{t\to\infty}M(t)=\lim_{t\to\infty} x(t)+y(t)+z(t)=1$.


\noindent{\bf 2.f.}
Use the result of {\bf 2.e} to write \eqref{sys:chemostat_nondim} as a 2-dimensional system involving the variables $y$ and $z$. This new system has 3 equilibria. Find them and study their local stability properties as a function of the parameters they involve. Summarize the situation as a function of the parameters.

\noindent{\bf Solution.}
Since $\lim_{t\to\infty} x(t)+y(t)+z(t)=1$, we can assume that $x=1-y-z$. Neglecting the equation for $x'$, \eqref{sys:chemostat_nondim} thus transforms into
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dT} y &= A(1-y-z)y-y-Byz \\
\frac{d}{dT} z &= Byz-z,
\end{align*}
which we can write as
\begin{subequations}\label{sys:chemostat_nondim_reduced}
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dT} y &= -\{A(y+z-1)+Bz+1\}y \label{sys:chemostat_nondim_reduced_y} \\
\frac{d}{dT} z &= (By-1)z. \label{sys:chemostat_nondim_reduced_z}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
At equilibrium, from \eqref{sys:chemostat_nondim_reduced_z}, $z=0$ or $y=1/B$.

Substitute $z=0$ into \eqref{sys:chemostat_nondim_reduced_y} at equilibrium:
\[
-\{A(y-1)+1\}y=0,
\]
so $y=0$ or $y=1+1/A$. So we find 2 equilibria, $(y,z)=(0,0)$ and $(y,z)=(1+1/A,0)$. Now substitute $y=1/B$ into \eqref{sys:chemostat_nondim_reduced_y} at equilibrium:
\[
-\left\{A\left(\frac 1B+z-1\right)+Bz+1\right\}\frac 1B=0,
\]
that is
\[
A\left(\frac 1B+z-1\right)+Bz+1=0,
\]
or, in other words,
\[
z=\frac{A-\dfrac AB-1}{A+B}.
\]
So we find a third equilibrium, 
\[
(y,z)=\left(\frac 1B,\frac{AB-A-B}{(A+B)B}\right).
\]

\noindent{\bf 2.g.}
Express the results of {\bf 2.f} for system \eqref{sys:chemostat_nondim}. Can you interpret these results? Can you relate these results to the original system \eqref{sys:chemostat}? Discuss the pros and cons of the original system versus the nondimensionalized system.

\noindent{\bf Solution.}
We have to add the third variable, $x=1-y-z$.

The expressions are nondimensional, so it is hard to interpret them biologically. The equilibria were, however, easier to compute using the nondimensionalized form. In general: nondimensionalization is useful for computations and
