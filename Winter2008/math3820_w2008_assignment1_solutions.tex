\begin{abstract}
The maximum mark was 55. Please look carefully at the method in exercises 4 and
5, for the existence. You had all the tools, just not the experience.. But from
now on, you will be expected to be able to tackle such a problem (of reasonable
difficulty).

Several of you (obviously, not the Math 3740 crowd) used the notation
$\because$ and $\therefore$. Be warned: these are taboo symbols for me. Taboo
means that I have to shut my eyes to avoid seeing them. And I don't usually see
what is located next to them either, since my eyes are closed, so I might
overlook your work.

The Ricker model of growth of a single population takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Ricker}
N_{t+1}=N_t e^{r\left(1-\frac{N_t}K\right)},
\end{equation}
with $r,K>0$ and initial condition $N_0>0$.

\vskip1cm
\noindent
{\bf 1. (5 points)} 
Setting $x_t=N_t/K$ is similar to saying that $N_t=Kx_t$. Substituting this value into \eqref{eq:Ricker}, we get
\begin{align*}
Kx_{t+1} &= Kx_t e^{r\left(1-\frac{Kx_t}K\right)} \\
&= Kx_t e^{r(1-x_t)},
\end{align*}
and therefore,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Ricker_dimless}
x_{t+1}=x_t e^{r(1-x_t)}.
\end{equation}
Note that $N$ has units \emph{number of individuals}, $K$ has units \emph{number of individuals}, and therefore $N/K$ is dimensionless.

\vskip0.4cm
\noindent
{\bf 2. (5 points)} 
Suppose that $x_0>0$. Then $x_1>0$, since $e^{r(1-x_0)}>0$ and $x_0>0$. Now suppose that $x_k>0$. Then $x_{k+1}>0$, since $e^{r(1-x_k)}>0$ and $x_k>0$. Therefore, by induction, $x_t>0$ for all $t$.

\vskip0.4cm
\noindent
{\bf 3. (15 points)} 
We set
\[
f(x)=xe^{r(1-x)}
\]
and seek $p$ such that $p=f(p)$. We have
\begin{align*}
p=f(p) &\Leftrightarrow p=pe^{r(1-p)} \\
&\Leftrightarrow p=0\textrm{ or }1=e^{r(1-p)} \\
&\Leftrightarrow p=0\textrm{ or }0=r(1-p)\qquad\textrm{(taking the $\ln$ of both sides)} \\
&\Leftrightarrow p=0\textrm{ or }p=1.
\end{align*}
So there are two fixed points, $0$ and $1$. To study the stability, we compute
\[
f'(x)=(1-rx)e^{r(1-x)}.
\]
Then
\[
|f'(0)|=|e^r|=e^r,
\]
so that $0$ is attracting if $r<0$ and repelling if $r>0$. Since it is assumed that $r>0$, $0$ is always repelling.
Also,
\[
|f'(1)|=|1-r|.
\]
So
\begin{align*}
|f'(1)|<1 &\Leftrightarrow |1-r|<1 \\
&\Leftrightarrow -1<1-r<1 \\
&\Leftrightarrow -2<-r<0 \\
&\Leftrightarrow 0<r<2.
\end{align*}
Therefore, if $0<r<2$, $1$ is attracting, and if $r>2$, $1$ is repelling.
\vskip0.2cm\noindent
To summarize: for all $r>0$, the fixed point 0 is repelling; for $0<r<2$, the fixed point 1 is attracting, while for $r>2$, it is repelling.
\vskip0.4cm
\noindent
{\bf 4. (10 points)} 
We have
\begin{align*}
f^2(x) &= f(f(x)) \\
&= f(x)e^{r(1-f(x))} \\
&= xe^{r(1-x)}e^{r(1-xe^{r(1-x)})}
\end{align*}
We have a period 2 point if $f^2(p)=p$ for some $p$, that is,
\[
p=pe^{r(1-p)}e^{r(1-pe^{r(1-p)})}.
\]
The first conclusion is that $p=0$ is a fixed point (but since 0 is also a fixed
point, it is not a point with \emph{least} period 2). Supposing now that $p\neq
0$, we thus must find $p$ such that
\[
1=e^{r(1-p)}e^{r(1-pe^{r(1-p)})}.
\]
Taking the $\ln$ of both sides of the equation, we have
\[
0=r(1-p)+r\left(1-pe^{r(1-p)}\right).
\]
Note that it is clear from this equation that $p=1$ is a fixed point of $f^2$
but, as for $p=0$, it is not a point with \emph{least} period 2, since $p=1$ is
also a fixed point.
Therefore, we must solve (for $p$) the equation
\[
r(1-p)+r(1-pe^{r(1-p)})=0,
\]
that is,
\[
r\left\{p\left(e^{r(1-p)}+1\right)-2\right\}=0.
\]
Since $r>0$, solving this is equivalent to finding the roots of the equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Gamma}
\Gamma(p)=p\left(e^{r(1-p)}+1\right)-2.
\end{equation}
We have $\Gamma(0)=-2$, and $\lim_{p\to\infty}\Gamma(p)=\infty$, therefore,
since $\Gamma$ is continuous, it must have at least one root. Clearly, $p=1$ is
such a root, but are there others?
We have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dGamma}
\Gamma'(p)=1+(1-rp)e^{r(1-p)}
\end{equation}
and
\[
\Gamma''(p)=-r(2-rp)e^{r(1-p)}
\]
At $0$, $\Gamma''(0)=-2re^r<0$, that is, $\Gamma$ is concave down. It then changes concavity when $rp=2$, i.e., for $p=2/r$, and then remains concave up for all values of $p>r/2$. Now note that since $0<r<2$, it follows that $1<2/r<\infty$, so that the inflection point occurs after $p=1$.

On the other hand, $\Gamma'(0)=1+e^r>0$, so $\Gamma$ is initially increasing, from the value $-2$. Putting all this together, we have that $\Gamma$ has the shape shown in Figures~\ref{fig:Gamma_1} and \ref{fig:Gamma_2}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{winter2008_assign1_fig1_a}
\caption{One possibility for $\Gamma$ that would lead to two positive period 2 points for \eqref{eq:Ricker_dimless}.}

\end{figure}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{winter2008_assign1_fig1_b}
\caption{One possibility for $\Gamma$ that would lead to $x=1$ as a positive period 2 point for \eqref{eq:Ricker_dimless}.}
\label{fig:Gamma_2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To be able to exclude the possibility of the case of Figure~\ref{fig:Gamma_1}
happening, we reason as follows. The main difference between
Figures~\ref{fig:Gamma_1} and \ref{fig:Gamma_2} is that when the inflection
point is reached, $\Gamma$ is increasing in Figure~\ref{fig:Gamma_2}. So a
sufficient condition for period 2 point is that
\[
\Gamma'\left(\frac 2r \right)>0.
\]
(Note that this is only sufficient: in Figure~\ref{fig:Gamma_1}, we see that if
$\Gamma$ is decreasing at the inflexion point, it is still possible for the
graph of $\Gamma$ not to intersect the $p$-axis after the inflexion point.)
We have
\[
\Gamma'\left(\frac 2r \right)=1-e^{r\left(1-\frac{2}{r}\right)}
\]
Recall that since $r<2$, we have $2/r>1$ and thus $1-2/r<0$. Therefore, since
$r>0$,
\[
e^{r\left(1-\frac{2}{r}\right)}<1
\]
and thus it is always true that $\Gamma'(2/r)>0$ when $r<2$. This means that
the sufficient condition we derived for there not to exist a point of least
period 2 is always satisfied, when $0<r<2$, i.e., when $0<r<2$, it is the
situation depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:Gamma_2} that prevails.

Therefore, when $0<r<2$, there are no points of least period 2.





\vskip0.4cm
\noindent
{\bf 5.  (10 points)} 
We use the same reasoning as in question 4, but here, we assume that $r>2$. The
first conclusion is that the inflection point $p=2/r<1$. At $p=2/r$,
\[
\Gamma\left(\frac 2r\right)=\frac 2r\left(e^{r-2}+1-r\right).
\]
This is clearly positive for $r>2$, since the function $\Theta(r)=e^{r-2}+1-r$
is such that $\Theta(2)=0$ and $\Theta'(r)=e^{r-2}-1>0$ for all $r>2$. It
follows that $\Gamma(2/r)>0$, that is, $\Gamma>0$ at the inflection point
$2/r$. As a consequence, since $\Gamma$ is continuous, there is a point $p_1^*\in(0,2/r)$ such that $\Gamma(p_1^*)=0$, i.e., a period 2 point $p_1^*$ in $(0,2/r)$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{winter2008_assign1_fig1_c}
\caption{One possibility for $\Gamma$ that leads to the existence of positive
period 2 points for \eqref{eq:Ricker_dimless}. (Case of Exercise 5, the
inflexion point $2/r$ of $\Gamma$ lies to the left of $p=1$.)}
\label{fig:Gamma_2b}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The curve $\Gamma$ then decreases and hits the $p$-axis for $p=1$. (Recall that
it was shown in Exercise 4 that $\Gamma(1)=0$.) Now, at the point $p=1$, we have
\[
\Gamma'(1)=2-r,
\]
which is negative since $r>2$. It follows, by continuity of $\Gamma$, that
there exists $\varepsilon>2$ such that $\Gamma(\varepsilon)<0$. There is no
other change of concavity of $\Gamma$ after $2/r$, $\Gamma$ is thus concave up
for $p>2/r$. As $\Gamma(\varepsilon)<0$ and
$\lim_{p\to\infty}\Gamma(p)=\infty$, this implies that there exists a unique
$p_2^*>1$ such that $\Gamma(p_2^*)=0$.

Therefore, for $r>2$, there exists $p_1^*\in(0,2/r)$ and $p_2^*>1$, period 2
points of $f$.
To study the stability of these period two points, we need to compute the
derivative of 
\[
f^2(x) = xe^{r(1-x)}e^{r(1-xe^{r(1-x)})},
\]
which is given by
\[
\frac{d}{dx}f^2(x) = (1-rx)e^{r(1-x)}
\left(
1-rxe^{r(1-x)}
\right)
e^{r\left(1-xe^{r(1-x)}\right)}.
\]
In principle, at this point we must substitute the value of the period 2 point in this equation, and check if the absolute value of this quantity is less or greater than 1. 

Let us illustrate the complexity of this approach using $x=p_1^*$. Since
\[
0<p_1^*<\frac 2r,
\]
we have
\[
1-\frac 2r<1-p_1^*<1
\]
and thus
\[
r\left(1-\frac 2r\right)<r(1-p_1^*)<r.
\]
As the exponential is an increasing function on $\IR$, this order is preserved when exponentiating this inequality, giving
\[
e^{r-2}<e^{r(1-p_1^*)}<e^r.
\]
