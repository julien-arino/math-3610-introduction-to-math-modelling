\frame{\frametitle{Objective}
We are given a table with the population census at different time intervals between a date $a$ and a date $b$, and want to get an expression for the population. This allows us to: 
\begin{itemize}
\item compute a value for the population at any time between the date $a$ and the date $b$ (\textbf{interpolation}),
\item predict a value for the population at a date before $a$ or after $b$ (\textbf{extrapolation}).
\end{itemize}

\section{A quadratic curve?}

\frame{\frametitle{First idea}
The curve looks like a piece of a parabola. So let us fit a curve of the form
\[
P(t)=a+bt+ct^2.
\]
To do this, we want to minimize
\[
S=\sum_{k=1}^{13} \left(P(t_k)-P_k\right)^2,
\]
where $t_k$ are the known dates, $P_k$ are the known populations, and $P(t_k)=a+bt_k+ct_k^2$.
}

\frame{ 
We proceed as in the notes (but note that the role of $a,b,c$ is reversed):
\[
S=S(a,b,c)=\sum_{k=1}^{13} \left(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k\right)^2
\]
is maximal if (necessary condition) $\partial S/\partial a=\partial S/\partial b=\partial S/\partial c=0$, with
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial a} &= 2\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k) \\
\frac{\partial S}{\partial b} &= 2\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k)t_k \\
\frac{\partial S}{\partial c} &= 2\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k)t_k^2
\end{align*}
}

\frame{
So we want
\begin{align*}
2\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k) &= 0\\
2\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k)t_k &= 0 \\
2\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k)t_k^2 &= 0,
\end{align*}
that is
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k) &= 0\\
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k)t_k &= 0 \\
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k)t_k^2 &= 0.
\end{align*}
}

\frame{
Rearranging the system
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k) &= 0\\
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k)t_k &= 0 \\
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2-P_k)t_k^2 &= 0,
\end{align*}
we get
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2) &= \sum_{k=1}^{13}P_k\\
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(at_k+bt_k^2+ct_k^3) &= \sum_{k=1}^{13}P_kt_k\\
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(at_k^2+bt_k^3+ct_k^4) &= \sum_{k=1}^{13}P_kt_k^2.
\end{align*}
}

\frame{
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(a+bt_k+ct_k^2) &= \sum_{k=1}^{13}P_k\\
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(at_k+bt_k^2+ct_k^3) &= \sum_{k=1}^{13}P_kt_k\\
\sum_{k=1}^{13}(at_k^2+bt_k^3+ct_k^4) &= \sum_{k=1}^{13}P_kt_k^2,
\end{align*}
after a bit of tidying up, takes the form
\begin{align*}
\left(\sum_{k=1}^{13}1\right)a+\left(\sum_{k=1}^{13}t_k\right)b+\left(\sum_{k=1}^{13}t_k^2\right)c &= \sum_{k=1}^{13}P_k \\
\left(\sum_{k=1}^{13}t_k\right)a+\left(\sum_{k=1}^{13}t_k^2\right)b+\left(\sum_{k=1}^{13}t_k^3\right)c &= \sum_{k=1}^{13}P_kt_k \\
\left(\sum_{k=1}^{13}t_k^2\right)a+\left(\sum_{k=1}^{13}t_k^3\right)b+\left(\sum_{k=1}^{13}t_k^4\right)c &= \sum_{k=1}^{13}P_kt_k^2.
\end{align*}
}

\frame{
So the aim is to solve the linear system
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
13 & \sum\limits_{k=1}^{13}t_k & \sum\limits_{k=1}^{13}t_k^2 \\
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{13}t_k & \sum\limits_{k=1}^{13}t_k^2 & \sum\limits_{k=1}^{13}t_k^3 \\
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{13}t_k^2 & \sum\limits_{k=1}^{13}t_k^3 & \sum\limits_{k=1}^{13}t_k^4
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a\\ b\\ c
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{13}P_k \\
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{13}P_kt_k \\
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{13}P_kt_k^2
\end{pmatrix}
\]
}

\frame[containsverbatim]{
With MatLab (or Octave), getting the values is easy.
\begin{itemize}
\item To apply an operation to every element in a vector or matrix, prefix the operation with a dot, hence
\begin{verbatim}
 t.^2;
\end{verbatim}
gives, for example, the vector with every element $t_k$ squared. 
\item Also, the function {\tt sum} gives the sum of the entries of a vector or matrix.
\item When entering a matrix or vector, separate entries on the same row by {\tt ,} and create a new row by using {\tt ;}.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame[containsverbatim]{
Thus, to set up the problem in the form of solving $Ax=b$, we need to do the following:
\begin{verbatim}
format long g;
A=[13,sum(t),sum(t.^2);sum(t),sum(t.^2),sum(t.^3);...
sum(t.^2),sum(t.^3),sum(t.^4)];
b=[sum(P);sum(P.*t);sum(P.*(t.^2))];
\end{verbatim}
The {\tt format long g} command is used to force the display of digits (normally, what is shown is in ``scientific'' notation, not very informative here). 
}

\frame[containsverbatim]{
Then, solve the system using
\begin{verbatim}
A\b
\end{verbatim}
We get the following output:
\begin{verbatim}
>> A\b

         Results may be inaccurate. RCOND = 1.118391e-020.

P(t)=22233186177.8195-24720291.325476t+6872.99686313725t^2

To see what this looks like,
\begin{verbatim}
plot(t,22233186177.8195-24720291.325476.*t...
+6872.99686313725.*t.^2);

In fact, to compare with original data:
\begin{verbatim}
plot(t,22233186177.8195-24720291.325476.*t...

Now we want to generate the table of values, to compare with the true values and thus compute the error. To do this, we can proceed directly:
\begin{verbatim}

\section{Population growth -- Logistic equation}

\frame{\frametitle{The logistic equation}
The logistic curve is the solution to the ordinary differential equation
\[
N'=rN\left(1-\frac NK\right),
\]
which is called the \textbf{logistic equation}. $r$ is the \textbf{intrinsic growth rate}, $K$ is the \textbf{carrying capacity}.
\vskip1cm
This equation was introduced by Pierre-Fran\c{c}ois Verhulst (1804-1849), in 1844.
}

\frame{\frametitle{Deriving the logistic equation}
The idea is to represent a population with the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item birth, at the \textbf{per capita} rate $b$,
\item death, at the \textbf{per capita} rate $d$,
\item competition of individuals with other individuals reduces their ability to survive, resulting in death.
\end{itemize}
This gives
\[
N'=bN-dN-\textrm{competition}.
\]
}

\frame{\frametitle{Accounting for competition}
Competition describes the mortality that occurs when two individuals meet.
\begin{itemize}
\item
In chemistry, if there is a concentration $X$ of one product and $Y$ of another product, then $XY$, called \textbf{mass action}, describes the number of interactions of molecules of the two products.
\item
Here, we assume that $X$ and $Y$ are of the same type (individuals). So there are $N^2$ contacts.
\item 
These $N^2$ contacts lead to death of one of the individuals at the rate $c$.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, the \textbf{logistic} equation is
\[
N'=bN-dN-cN^2.
\]
}

\frame{\frametitle{Reinterpreting the logistic equation}
The equation
\[
N'=bN-dN-cN^2
\]
is rewritten as
\[
N'=(b-d)N-cN^2.
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item $b-d$ represents the rate at which the population increases (or decreases) in the absence of competition. It is called the \textbf{intrinsic growth rate} of the population.
\item $c$ is the rate of \textbf{intraspecific} competition. The prefix \textbf{intra} refers to the fact that the competition is occurring between members of the same species, that is, within the species.\newline
[We will see later examples of \textbf{interspecific} competition, that is, between different species.]

\frame{\frametitle{Another (..) interpretation of the logistic equation}
We have
\[
N'=(b-d)N-cN^2.

Factor out an $N$:

N'=\bigl((b-d)-cN\bigr)N.
\]
This gives us another interpretation of the logistic equation. Writing
\[
\frac{N'}N=(b-d)-cN,
\]
we have $N'/N$, the \textbf{per capita growth rate} of $N$, given by a constant, $b-d$, minus a \textbf{density dependent inhibition} factor, $cN$.

\section{Qualitative analysis of the logistic equation}

\frame{\frametitle{Studying the logistic equation qualitatively}
We study
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logistic_ode}
N'=rN\left(1-\frac NK\right).\tag{ODE1}
\end{equation}
For this, write
\[
f(N)=rN\left(1-\frac NK\right).
\]
Consider the initial value problem (IVP) 
\begin{equation}\label{ivp:logistic_ode}
N'=f(N),\quad N(0)=N_0>0.\tag{IVP1}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is $C^1$ (differentiable with continuous derivative) so solutions to \eqref{ivp:logistic_ode} exist and are unique.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\textbf{Equilibria} of \eqref{eq:logistic_ode} are points such that $f(N)=0$ (so that $N'=f(N)=0$, meaning $N$ does not vary). So we solve $f(N)=0$ for $N$. We find two points:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N=0$
\item $N=K$.
\end{itemize}
By uniqueness of solutions to \eqref{ivp:logistic_ode}, solutions cannot cross the lines $N(t)=0$ and $N(t)=K$.
}

\frame{
There are several cases.
\begin{itemize}
\item $N=0$ for some $t$, then $N(t)=0$ for all $t\geq 0$, by uniqueness of solutions.
\item $N\in(0,K)$, then $rN>0$ and $N/K<1$ so $1-N/K>0$, which implies that $f(N)>0$. As a consequence, $N(t)$ increases if $N\in(0,K)$.
\item $N=K$, then $rN>0$ but $N/K=1$ so $1-N/K=0$, which implies that $f(N)=0$. As a consequence, $N(t)=K$ for all $t\geq 0$, by uniqueness of solutions.
\item $N>K$, the $rN>0$ and $N/K>1$, implying that $1-N/K<0$ and in turn, $f(N)<0$. As a consequence, $N(t)$ decreases if $N\in(K,+\infty)$.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
Therefore,
\begin{theorem}
Suppose that $N_0>0$. Then the solution $N(t)$ of \eqref{ivp:logistic_ode} is such that
\[
\lim_{t\to\infty} N(t)=K,
\]
so that $K$ is the number of individuals that the environment can support, the \textbf{carrying capacity} of the environment.

If $N_0=0$, then $N(t)=0$ for all $t\geq 0$.
\end{theorem}
}


\section{The delayed logistic equation}
\frame{\frametitle{The delayed logistic equation}
Consider the equation as
\[
\frac{N'}{N}=(b-d)-cN,
\]
that is, the per capita rate of growth of the population depends on the net growth rate $b-d$, and some density dependent inhibition $cN$ (resulting of competition).
\vskip0.5cm
Suppose that instead of instantaneous inhibition, there is some delay $\tau$ between the time the inhibiting event takes place and the moment when it affects the growth rate.
\vskip0.5cm
For example, two individuals fight for food, and one later dies of the injuries sustained during this fight.
}

\frame{\frametitle{The delayed logistic equation}
In the case of a time $\tau$ between inhibiting event and inhibition, the equation would be written as
\[
\frac{N'}N=(b-d)-cN(t-\tau).
\]
Using the change of variables introduced earlier, this is written
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logistic_dde}
N'(t)=rN(t)\left(1-\frac{N(t-\tau)}K\right). \tag{DDE1}
\end{equation}
Such an equation is called a \textbf{delay} differential equation. It is much more complicated to study than \eqref{eq:logistic_ode}. In fact, some things remain unknown about \eqref{eq:logistic_dde}.
}

\frame{\frametitle{Delayed initial value problem}
The IVP takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{ivp:logistic_dde}
\begin{aligned}
N'(t)&= rN(t)\left(1-\frac{N(t-\tau)}K\right),\\
N(t) &= \phi(t)\textrm{ for }t\in[-\tau,0],
\end{aligned} \tag{IVP2}
\end{equation}
where $\phi(t)$ is some continuous function. Hence, initial conditions (called initial data in this case) must be specified on an interval, instead of being specified at a point, to guarantee existence and uniqueness of solutions.

We will not learn how to study this type of equation (this is graduate level mathematics). I will give a few results.
}

\frame{
To find equilibria, remark that delay should not play a role, since $N$ should be constant. Thus, equilibria are found by considering the equation with no delay, which is \eqref{eq:logistic_ode}.
\begin{theorem}
Suppose that $r\tau<\pi/2$. Then solutions of \eqref{ivp:logistic_dde} with positive initial data $\phi(t)$ starting close enough to $K$ tend to $K$. If $r\tau<37/24$, then all solutions of  \eqref{ivp:logistic_dde} with positive initial data $\phi(t)$ tend to $K$. If $r\tau>\pi/2$, then $K$ is an unstable equilibrium and all solutions of \eqref{ivp:logistic_dde} with positive initial data $\phi(t)$ on $[-\tau,0]$ are oscillatory.
\end{theorem}
\vskip1cm

There is a gray zone between $37/24$ ($\simeq 1.5417$) and $\pi/2$ ($\simeq 1.5708$). The global aspect was proved for $r\tau<37/24$ in 1945 by Wright. Although there is very strong numerical evidence that this is in fact true up to $\pi/2$, nobody has yet managed to prove it.
}

\section{The logistic map}

\frame{\frametitle{Discrete-time systems}
So far, we have seen continuous-time models, where $t\in\IR_+$. Another way to model natural phenomena is by using a discrete-time formalism, that is, to consider equations of the form
\[
x_{t+1}=f(x_t),
\]
where $t\in\IN$ or $\IZ$, that is, $t$ takes values in a discrete valued (countable) set.
\vskip0.5cm
Time could for example be days, years, etc.
}


\frame{\frametitle{The logistic map}
The logistic \textbf{map} is, for $t\geq 0$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logistic_discrete}
N_{t+1}=rN_t\left(1-\frac{N_t}K\right). \tag{DT1}
\end{equation}
To transform this into an initial value problem, we need to provide an initial condition $N_0\geq 0$ for $t=0$.
}


\frame{\frametitle{Some mathematical analysis}
Suppose we have a system in the form
\[
x_{t+1}=f(x_t),
\]
with initial condition given for $t=0$ by $x_0$. Then,
\begin{align*}
x_1 &= f(x_0) \\
x_2 &= f(x_1)= f(f(x_0))\stackrel{\Delta}{=} f^2(x_0) \\
& \vdots \\
x_k &= f^k(x_0).
\end{align*}
The $f^k=\underbrace{f\circ f\circ\cdots\circ f}_{k\textrm{ times}}$ are called the \textbf{iterates} of $f$.
}

\frame{\frametitle{Fixed points}
\begin{definition}[Fixed point]
Let $f$ be a function. A point $p$ such that $f(p)=p$ is called a \textbf{fixed point} of $f$.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
Consider the closed interval $I=[a,b]$. If $f:I\to I$ is continuous, then $f$ has a fixed point in $I$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $I$ be a closed interval and $f:I\to\IR$ be a continuous function. If $f(I)\supset I$, then $f$ has a fixed point in $I$.
\end{theorem}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Periodic points}
\begin{definition}[Periodic point]
Let $f$ be a function. If there exists a point $p$ and an integer $n$ such that
\[
f^n(p)=p,\quad\textrm{but}\quad f^k(p)\neq p\textrm{ for }k<n,
\]
then $p$ is a periodic point of $f$ with (least) period $n$ (or a $n$-periodic point of $f$).
\end{definition}
\vskip0.5cm
Thus, $p$ is a $n$-periodic point of $f$ iff $p$ is a $1$-periodic point of $f^n$.
}


\frame{\frametitle{Stability of fixed points, of periodic points}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be a continuously differentiable function (that is, differentiable with continuous derivative, or $C^1$), and $p$ be a fixed point of $f$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $|f'(p)|<1$, then there is an open interval $\mathcal{I}\ni p$ such that $\lim_{k\to\infty}f^k(x)=p$ for all $x\in\mathcal{I}$.
\item If $|f'(p)|>1$, then there is an open interval $\mathcal{I}\ni p$ such that if $x\in\mathcal{I}$, $x\neq p$, then there exists $k$ such that $f^k(x)\not\in\mathcal{I}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{definition}
Suppose that $p$ is a $n$-periodic point of $f$, with $f\in C^1$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $|\left(f^n\right)'(p)|<1$, then $p$ is an \textbf{attracting} periodic point of $f$. 
\item If $|\left(f^n\right)'(p)|>1$, then $p$ is an \textbf{repelling} periodic point of $f$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Parametrized families of functions}
Consider the equation \eqref{eq:logistic_discrete}, which for convenience we rewrite as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logistic_discrete_scaled}
N_{t+1}=rN_t(1-N_t)\tag{DT2},
\end{equation}
where $r$ is a parameter in $\IR_+$, and $N$ will typically be taken in $[0,1]$. Let
\[
f_r(x)=rx(1-x).
\]
The function $f_r$ is called a \textbf{parametrized family} of functions.
}

\frame{\frametitle{Bifurcations}
\begin{definition}[Bifurcation]
Let $f_\mu$ be a parametrized family of functions. Then there is a \textbf{bifurcation} at $\mu=\mu_0$ (or $\mu_0$ is a bifurcation point) if there exists $\varepsilon>0$ such that, if $\mu_0-\varepsilon<a<\mu_0$ and $\mu_0<b<\mu_0+\varepsilon$, then the dynamics of $f_a(x)$ are ``different'' from the dynamics of $f_b(x)$.
\end{definition}
\vskip0.5cm
An example of ``different'' would be that $f_a$ has a fixed point (that is, a 1-periodic point) and $f_b$ has a 2-periodic point.
}


\frame{\frametitle{Back to the logistic map}
Consider the simplified version \eqref{eq:logistic_discrete_scaled},
\[
N_{t+1}=rN_t(1-N_t)\stackrel{\Delta}{=}f_r(N_t).
\]
{\bf Are solutions well defined?}
Suppose $N_0\in[0,1]$, do we stay in $[0,1]$? 
$f_r$ is continuous on $[0,1]$, so it has a extrema on $[0,1]$. We have
\[
f_r'(x)=r-2rx=r(1-2x),
\]
which implies that $f_r$ increases for $x<1/2$ and decreases for $x>1/2$, reaching a maximum at $x=1/2$. 
\vskip0.5cm
$f_r(0)=f_r(1)=0$ are the minimum values, and $f(1/2)=r/4$ is the maximum. Thus, if we want $N_{t+1}\in[0,1]$ for $N_t\in[0,1]$, we need to consider $r\leq 4$.
}

\frame{
\begin{itemize}
\item Note that if $N_0=0$, then $N_t=0$ for all $t\geq 1$. 
\item Similarly, if $N_0=1$, then $N_1=0$, and thus $N_t=0$ for all $t\geq 1$.
\item This is true for all $t$: if there exists $t_k$ such that $N_{t_k}=1$, then $N_t=0$ for all $t\geq t_k$.
\item This last case might occur if $r=4$, as we have seen.
\item Also, if $r=0$ then $N_t=0$ for all $t$.
\end{itemize}
For these reasons, we generally consider
\[
N\in(0,1)
\]
and
\[
r\in(0,4).
\]
}

\frame{\frametitle{Fixed points: existence}
{\bf Fixed points} of \eqref{eq:logistic_discrete_scaled} satisfy $N=rN(1-N)$, giving:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N=0$;
\item $1=r(1-N)$, that is, $p\stackrel{\Delta}{=}\dfrac{r-1}{r}$. 
\end{itemize}
Note that $\lim_{r\to 0^+}p=1-\lim_{r\to 0^+}1/r=-\infty$, $\frac{\partial}{\partial r}p=1/r^2>0$ (so $p$ is an increasing function of $r$), $p=0\Leftrightarrow r=1$ and $\lim_{r\to\infty}p=1$. 
So we come to this first conclusion:
\begin{itemize}
\item 0 always is a fixed point of $f_r$.
\item If $0<r<1$, then $p$ takes negative values so is not relevant.
\item If $1<r<4$, then $p$ exists.
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Stability of the fixed points}
{\bf Stability} of the fixed points is determined by the (absolute) value $f_r'$ at these fixed points. We have
\[
|f'_r(0)|=r,
\]
and
\begin{align*}
|f'_r(p)| &= \left|r-2r\dfrac{r-1}{r}\right|\\
&= |r-2(r-1)| \\
&= |2-r|
\end{align*}
Therefore, we have
\begin{itemize}
\item if $0<r<1$, then the fixed point $N=p$ does not exist and $N=0$ is attracting,
\item if $1<r<3$, then $N=0$ is repelling, and $N=p$ is attracting,
\item if $r>3$, then $N=0$ and $N=p$ are repelling.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{bif_cascade_1}
\end{center}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Another bifurcation}
Thus the points $r=1$ and $r=3$ are bifurcation points. To see what happens when $r>3$, we need to look for period 2 points.

\begin{align}
f_r^2(x) &= f_r(f_r(x)) \nonumber\\
&= r f_r(x)(1-f_r(x)) \nonumber\\
&= r^2 x(1-x)(1-r x(1-x)). \label{eq:f_mu_2_a}
\end{align}
0 and $p$ are points of period 2, since a fixed point $x^*$ of $f$ satisfies $f(x^*)=x^*$, and so, $f^2(x^*)=f(f(x^*))=f(x^*)=x^*$. 

This helps localizing the other periodic points. Writing the fixed point equation as
\[
Q(x)\stackrel{\Delta}{=}f_r^2(x)-x=0,
\]
we see that, since $0$ and $p$ are fixed points of $f_\mu^2$, they are roots of $Q(x)$. Therefore, $Q$ can be factorized as
\[
Q(x)=x(x-p)(-r^3x^2+Bx+C),
\]
}


\frame{
Substitute the value $(r-1)/r$ for $p$ in $Q$, develop $Q$ and \eqref{eq:f_mu_2_a} and equate coefficients of like powers gives
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Q}
Q(x)=x\left(x-\frac{r-1}{r}\right)\left(-r^3 x^2+r^2(r+1)x-r(r+1)\right).
\end{equation}
We already know that $x=0$ and $x=p$ are roots of \eqref{eq:Q}. So we search for roots of
\[
R(x):=-r^3 x^2+r^2(r+1)x-r(r+1).
\]
Discriminant is 
\begin{align*}
\Delta &=r^4(r+1)^2-4r^4(r+1)\\ 
&= r^4(r+1)(r+1-4)\\
&= r^4(r+1)(r-3). 
\end{align*}
Therefore, $R$ has distinct real roots if $r>3$.
Remark that for $r=3$, the (double) root is $p=2/3$. For $r>3$ but very close to 3, it follows from the continuity of $R$ that the roots are close to $2/3$.

\frame{\frametitle{Descartes' rule of signs}
\begin{theorem}[Descartes' rule of signs]\label{th:descartes}
Let $p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^m a_ix^i $ be a polynomial with real coefficients such that $a_m \neq 0$.
Define $v$ to be the number of {\it variations in sign} of the sequence of coefficients $a_m, \ldots, a_0$. By 'variations in sign' we mean the number of values of $n$ such that the sign of $a_n$ differs from the sign of $a_{n - 1}$, as $n$ ranges from $m$ down to 1.
Then 
\begin{itemize}
\item the number of positive real roots of $p(x)$ is $v-2N$ for some integer $N$ satisfying $0 \leq N \leq \dfrac{v}{2}$,
\item the number of negative roots of $p(x)$ may be obtained by the same method by applying the rule of signs to $p(-x)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Example of use of Descartes' rule}
\begin{example}
Let 
\[
p(x) = x^3+3x^2-x-3.
\] 
Coefficients have signs $++--$, i.e., 1 sign change.
Thus $v = 1$. Since $0 \leq N \leq 1/2$, we must have $N=0$. Thus $v-2N=1$ and there is exactly one positive real root of $p(x)$.

To find the negative roots, we examine $p(-x) = -x^3+3x^2+x-3$. Coefficients have signs $-++-$, i.e., 2 sign changes. Thus $v=2$ and $0 \leq N \leq 2/2= 1$.
Thus, there are two possible solutions, $N=0$ and $N=1$, and two possible values of $v-2N$. Therefore, there are either two or no negative real roots.
Furthermore, note that $p(-1)=(-1)^3+3 \cdot (-1)^2-(-1)-3=0$, hence there is at least one negative root. Therefore there must be exactly two.
\end{example}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Back to the logistic map and the polynomial $R$..}
We use Descartes' rule of signs. 
\begin{itemize}
\item
$R$ has signed coefficients $-+-$, so 2 sign changes imlying 0 or 2 positive real roots. 
\item
$R(-x)$ has signed coefficients $---$, so no negative real roots. 
\item 
Since $\Delta>0$, the roots are real, and thus it follows that both roots are positive.
\end{itemize}
To show that the roots are also smaller than 1, consider the change of variables $z=x-1$. The polynomial $R$ is transformed into 
\begin{align*}
R_2(z) &= -r^3 (z+1)^2+r^2(r+1)(z+1)-r(r+1) \\
&= -r^3z^2+r^2(1-r)z-r.
\end{align*}
For $r>1$, the signed coefficients are $---$, so $R_2$ has no root $z>0$, implying in turn that $R$ has no root $x>1$.

\section{Conclusion}

\frame{\frametitle{A word of caution}
We have used three different modelling paradigms to describe the growth of a population in a \textbf{logistic} framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item The ODE version has monotone solutions converging to the carrying capacity $K$.
\item The DDE version has oscillatory solutions, either converging to $K$ or, if the delay is too large, periodic about $K$.
\item The discrete time version has all sorts of behaviors, and can be chaotic.
\end{itemize}
It is important to be aware that the {\bf choice of modelling method} is almost {\bf as important} in the outcome of the model as the precise formulation/hypotheses of the {\bf model}.
